"after" is a rubygem/command line executable that allows you to basically

"run program 1 in a console"
"run program 2 in a different console, after program 1 terminates"

so you can basically line up your ducks of run this then run that (with guaranteed order).  
Works in linux and windows.  Especially useful in windows where you can't just type in your next command
while the first is still running.  Sometimes also useful in linux (since by default you can't wait on a pid 
that's not from a current child process).  See https://github.com/rdp/wait_pid for details.

To use (install ruby then):
$ gem install after
$ after --help

See the included file bin/after for list of options.
